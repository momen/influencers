# Influencer Marketing Platforms
act as support to make life easier for both agencies and brands when managing and working with influencers. An influencer marketing platform is a special online tool designed to assist brands operate their influencer marketing campaigns. The initial influencer marketing platforms provided influencer discovery tools for brands and some agencies. Some of these offer massive searchable databases of potential influencers, using clever algorithms. Others prefer an opt-in method for influencers, where the staff of the influencer marketing platform can vet potential influencers and check that they are genuine and willing to work with brands. More recently influencer platforms have expanded their offerings, to include relationship management, campaign management, influencer marketplaces, third party analytics, and influencer content amplification.

Of course, anything that grows organically and without planning can lead to blurred boundaries. There are agencies who also provide the same services as platforms and there are platforms who provide what would normally be considered as agency services. Then, then there are talent agencies, who call themselves agencies but are really more influencer marketing platforms.

As a result, we have had to make some arbitrary decisions about whether to include some firms in this list or in our agency list. Here is a list of the top 25 Influencer Marketing Platforms we came across.
